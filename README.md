# Lesson 2:  Representing Programs

## Benchmark
*
```sh
# Compile the typescript benchmark into bril, and run it using brili

```

## Bril Program Analysis
```sh
# Run python script that counts the number of branch instructions

# Use turnt to test the analysis
```

## Basic Block && CFG Generation Algorithm
```sh
# Run python script that generates the basic blocks and CFG of a bril program and prints the result
```
